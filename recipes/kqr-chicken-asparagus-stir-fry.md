## Ingredients

- Hot cooked white rice, for serving
- 3 tbsp honey
- ¾ tsp black pepper
- 2 tbsp flour
- 1 ½ tsp ground tumeric
- 1 lb boneless skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch pieces
- 1 tbsp coconut or vegetable oil
- 1 bunch asparagus, woody ends snapped off and thinly sliced on an angle
- 1 tsp unseasoned rice vinegar or soy sauce
- Lime wedges for serving (optional)

## Instructions

1. In a 1-cup measuring cup, whisk together ¼ cup water with the honey, pepper, and ¼ tsp table salt. You may need to heat the honey up a little if it's really thick. Set aside.
2. In a bowl big enough to fit the chicken pieces, stir together the flour, turmeric, and ½ tsp table salt. Add the chicken and toss well to coat.
3. In a nonstick skillet, heat the oil over medium-high. Add the chicken and cook until the turmeric is fragrant and the chicken is golden brown, about 5-6 minutes.
4. Add the asparagus to the skillet and cook until crisp-tender, 1-2 minutes.
5. Add the honey mixture and cook, stirring, until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce has thickened, about 2-3 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in the vinegar. Done!

## Serving suggestions

Serve over rice, with lime wedges on the side.
