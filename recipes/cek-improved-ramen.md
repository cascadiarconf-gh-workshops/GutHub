## Ingredients

- Favorite instant ramen (mine is Sapporo Ichiban Tonkotsu Ramen)
- 2 green onions / scallions
- other vegetables to taste (e.g.: radish, carrot, mushrooms)
- 1 hard-boiled egg (optional)
- available pre-cooked meat (optional, left-overs are great for this!)
- toasted sesame seeds
- Sriracha
- Water and/or vegetable stock

## Instructions

Not rocket science, from someone who doesn't cook too often!

1. Prepare green onions and any vegetables by finely slicing at an angle.
2. Sautee mushrooms (if using).
3. Slice meat thinly.
4. Refer to ramen packet for amount of water needed.  Replace with stock if desired.
5. Bring water / stock to a boil.
6. Cook noodles for specified time.
7. Add ramen flavor packet if desired.
8. Add meat and egg to bowl.
9. Pour hot soup into the bowl.
10. Season with sriracha and sesame seeds.

## Serving Suggestions

How hungry are you?

Comfort food for a cloudy day.
