## Ingredients

- Chips (preferably tortilla chips)
- Shredded cheese (preferably one that melts)
- Sliced olives
- Fresh diced tomatoes
- A protein (preferably an edible one)
- Green onions (preferably chopped)
- Refried beans
- An oven that can reach a temperature of 450F (or an air fryer if you want to make a mess)
- A sheet pan large enough to hold all the things you chopped up

## Instructions

1. Mash everything together in a bowl
2. Dump it on to your sheet pan
3. Bake until the cheese has melted
   
## Serving Suggestions
- I actually don't suggest eating this recipe or making nachos this way.
