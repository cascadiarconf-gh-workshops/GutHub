## Ingredients

- Cooked white rice 
- 1 can spam (any type or your favorite flavor)
- Nori (roasted seaweed, ideally the "sheet" type like the Sushihane brand [like this one] (https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcQA1Pbi-B1iXZGct4wO5pSUGIo_0vuLoTn8boyFkBMW-Y2nlKoojR-FON_xDqU3VBjH-pAUBmopgxRsUabnQS7lJ-El0a7BPKNbJihztMrtuk5eBNiBKnvLdQ))
- Furikake seasoning
- Shoyu
- Brown sugar
- Optional: musubi mold (OR don't toss the spam can -- it can be used as a mold)

## Instructions

1. Prep spam and sauce: cut spam to 1/4" or desired thickness, set aside. Mix 1 cup shoyu and 1 tablespoon brown sugar in a mixing bowl. Toss cut spam in bowl to marinate. Set aside.
2. Cut nori into 2" strips. Set aside. 
3. Heat up pan to low-medium heat. Fry marinated spam to desired crispiness. Keep an eye on the heat, too much heat will burn the spam.
4. Assemble musubis: fill spam can 1/4 full with cooked rice, sprinkle furikake seasoning on top of rice, add crispy spam. Once musubi is to desired shape, wrap 1 nori around musubi.
2. If you'd like to include an image, upload your image to the `recipes/images/` folder. See #3 before uploading.
e.md's image filename in the frontmatter (between `---`). It looks like this: `image: "./images/your-image-filename.jpg"`
