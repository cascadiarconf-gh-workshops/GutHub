## Ingredients

- oil spray
- 16 ounces package potato gnocchi , the shelf-stable kind found in the pasta aisle
- 12 ounces cooked chicken sausage links, cut into bite-sized pieces
- ½ large red onion, thinly sliced
- 2 medium bell peppers, thinly sliced
- 24 ounces grape or cherry tomatoes
- 1½ Tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- ½ teaspoon kosher salt
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon dried Italian seasoning, or dried oregano
- 8 ounces small fresh mozzarella balls 
- Fresh basil leaves, optional garnish

## Instructions

1. Add your instructions here in a numbered list for people to follow.
2. If you'd like to include an image, upload your image to the `recipes/images/` folder. See #3 before uploading.
3. Make sure you rename your image with the same name as your recipe file before uploading.
4. Change the recipe.md's image filename in the frontmatter (between `---`). It looks like this: `image: "./images/your-image-filename.jpg"`

1. Heat the oven to 425℉ degrees. Lightly grease a rimmed baking sheet with oil spray.
2. Add the gnocchi, sausage, onion, peppers, and tomatoes to the center of the baking sheet.
3. Drizzle the olive oil over the top then sprinkle with the salt, pepper, garlic powder, and Italian seasoning. Toss everything together with your hands or tongs.
4. Spread everything into an even layer then place in the oven to roast. Cook until the vegetables and gnocchi are brown in spots and the tomatoes burst, about 25 to 30 minutes. Stir the pan after 15 minutes to allow everything to cook more evenly.
5. Remove the pan from the oven then distribute the mozzarella balls over the gnocchi. Place the pan back in the oven to melt the cheese, 3 to 4 more minutes. (You can also place the pan under the broiler to melt the cheese faster.)
6. Once the cheese is melted, tear the fresh basil leaves over the top then serve.

## Serving Suggestions
- Adding the mozzarella cheese and basil is optional!

This is my go-to, easy cleanup meal for when I don't want to actively "cook". The oven does all the work!
