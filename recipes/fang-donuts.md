## Ingredients

- 1 cup (240 ml) **whole milk**, warmed to ~100°F (38°C)
- 2¼ teaspoons (7 g) **active dry yeast** (1 packet)
- ¼ cup (50 g) **granulated sugar**
- 2 large **eggs**, room temperature
- 4 tablespoons (56 g) **unsalted butter**, melted and slightly cooled
- 1 teaspoon **vanilla extract**
- ½ teaspoon **salt**
- ¼ teaspoon **ground nutmeg**
- 4 cups (480 g) **all-purpose flour**, plus more for dusting
- Oil for frying (vegetable, canola, or peanut oil)

## Optional for Glaze

- 2 cups (240 g) **powdered sugar**
- ¼ cup (60 ml) **milk**
- 1 teaspoon **vanilla extract**
  
## 🧑‍🍳 Instructions

1. **Prepare the dough**  
   In a large bowl or stand mixer, combine warm milk and yeast. Let sit for 5–10 minutes until foamy.  
   Add sugar, eggs, melted butter, vanilla, salt, nutmeg, and half the flour. Mix until combined.  
   Gradually add the remaining flour and knead until the dough is smooth and slightly tacky (about 5–7 minutes).

2. **Let the dough rise**  
   Transfer the dough to a greased bowl. Cover and let it rise in a warm area for 1–2 hours, or until doubled in size.

3. **Roll & cut into doughnuts**  
   Punch down the risen dough. Roll it out on a floured surface to about ½ inch thickness.  
   Use a donut cutter (or two round cutters) to cut out the donuts and holes. Place them on a floured tray.  
   Cover and let them rise for 30–45 minutes until puffy.

4. **Prepare the oil**  
   Heat oil in a deep fryer or large pot to 350°F (175°C).  
   Line a tray with paper towels and place a wire rack on top.

5. **Fry the doughnuts**  
   Carefully lower donuts into hot oil, frying 2–3 at a time. Fry 1–2 minutes per side or until golden brown.  
   Remove and drain on the rack. While warm, glaze or coat with sugar as desired.


## 🍽️ Serving Suggestions (台式甜甜圈風格建議)

- Coat with **fine sugar** mixed with a little milk powder for a nostalgic Taiwanese touch.
- Drizzle with **condensed milk** and sprinkle **crushed peanuts** for a dessert-style twist.
- Pair with **soy milk** (豆漿) or **milk tea** (奶茶) for a perfect afternoon snack.

## 👩‍🎓 About Me

I’m an international student from **Taiwan**, currently pursuing my **Master of Science in Finance (MSF)** at **Portland State University (PSU)**. Living and studying in Portland, I’ve fallen in love with the city's unique donut culture—especially the **Turkish-inspired donut shop** near Portland area and the iconic **Voodoo Doughnut** in downtown. These flavors have inspired me to experiment in my own kitchen.

This recipe brings together classic donut techniques with a soft, slightly chewy texture that Taiwanese dessert lovers might find familiar—like a cross between a fluffy milk bread and a sugar-coated fried treat.
