# Brazilian Beans and Rice

## Ingredients
- 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened
- 3/4 cup granulated sugar
- 3/4 cup brown sugar (packed)
- 2 large eggs
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 2 cups (about 12 oz) semisweet chocolate chips
- Optional: 1 cup chopped nuts (e.g. walnuts or pecans)

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C) and line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone mats.
2. In a large bowl, beat together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy (2–3 minutes).
3. Next, beat in the eggs one at a time and mix in vanilla extract.
4. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt.
5. Gradually add your dry ingredients to the wet mixture and mix until just combined.
6. Fold in chocolate chips (and nuts, if using).
7. Drop spoonfuls of dough (about 1.5 tbsp each) onto prepared baking sheets, spacing 2 inches apart.
8. Bake for 10–12 minutes, or until edges are golden and centers still look slightly soft.
9. Let cookies cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack.
