# Brazilian Beans and Rice

## Ingredients
- 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts, pounded to even thickness
- 1 tablespoon melted butter or olive oil
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly-ground black pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika

## Instructions
1. Brine the chicken. Fill a large mixing bowl with 2 cups of lukewarm water and 1/4 cup of kosher salt. Stire to combine. Add 2 cups of cold water to lower the temperature until it's cool to the touch. Add the chicken breasts and let them sit in the mixture to brine for 15 minutes. Remove the chicken breasts from the brine, rince them with cold water, pat them dry with paper towels.
2. Preheat the oven to 450°F
3. Season the chicken. Place the chicken breasts in a single layer in a large baking dish. Brush on both sides evenly with melted butter or olive oil. In a separate small bowl, whisk the salt, pepper, garlic powder, and paprika until combined. Sprinkle the seasoning mixture evenly over the chicken on both sides.
4. Bake. Bake for 15-18 minutes (until the thickest part of the breast is 165°F). If browned and crispy chicken breasts are desired, turn the broiler on high for the final 3-5 minutes of cooking time and broil the chicken until it is cooked through and golden on top.
5. Rest the chicken. Once the chicken is cooked, remove the pan from the oven, transfer the chicken to a clean plate, loosely tent the plate with aluminum foil and let rest for 5-10 minutes.
6. Serve and enjoy!
