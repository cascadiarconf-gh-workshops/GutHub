A training repository to practice GitHub fundamentals by creating markdown recipes and sharing them.

# Welcome to **GutHub**!

**Where GitHub Meets Good Grub!**

> GutHub is a fun and interactive way to practice your GitHub skills while sharing your favorite recipes! Hopefully you arrived here during a workshop and have some other instructions. If you didn't, and know the basics of GitHub, see below for some simple instructions.

## 📖 How It Works
- Create a new branch
- Copy the template from the cookbook [here](https://cascadiarconf-gh-workshops.github.io/GutHub/template-recipe.html) into a new file in your branch's `recipe` folder to get started.
- Name the file with your initials and a short title followed by the `.md` extension like `ynh-banana-pudding.md`
- Modify the template and convert your favorite recipe to Markdown (.md) format. Preview your work!
- Finally, when ready, commit your recipe markdown file. Make sure it's within the `/recipes` folder!
- [Optionally] Add an image of your recipe's product with the same name to the `/recipes/images` folder and use it from your recipe!
- Follow the [GitHub Flow](https://youtu.be/ykDGsbeblOs) to submit a pull request and ask for a review by someone you know.
- Review contributions from fellow GitHub chefs-in-training.
- Once merged, your recipe will be **automatically included** into our community cookbook!
