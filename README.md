# Welcome to **GutHub**!

**Where GitHub Meets Good Grub!**

> GutHub is a fun and interactive way to practice your GitHub skills while sharing your favorite recipes!\
> If you've completed the **[GitHub Basics Track](https://cuddly-adventure-n862rpv.pages.github.io/userguides/userguide-github.html)**, this is your chance to put your knowledge to the test\
> After the Basics Track, **[GitHub Basics - Workshop 1](https://github.com/DOH-EPI-Coders/github-basics-workshop-1)** walks though contributing to this **collaborative community cookbook**. 

## 📖 How It Works
- Create a new branch
- Copy the template from the cookbook [here](https://effective-adventure-z2o86yg.pages.github.io/template-recipe.html) into a new file in your branch's `recipe` folder to get started.
- Name the file with your initials and a short title followed by the `.md` extension like `ynh-banana-pudding.md`
- Modify the template and convert your favorite recipe to Markdown (.md) format. Preview your work!
- Finally, when ready, commit your recipe markdown file. Make sure it's within the `/recipes` folder!
- [Optionally] Add an image of your recipe's product with the same name to the `/recipes/images` folder and use it from your recipe!
- Follow the [GitHub Flow](https://stateofwa.sharepoint.com/:v:/r/sites/DOH-Epi-Coders/Shared%20Documents/General/GitHub/Training/Basics%20Track/Epi-Coders-GH-Basics-GitHub-Flow-SEP2024.webm?csf=1&web=1&e=48ifPG) to submit a pull request and ask for a review by someone you know.
- Review contributions from fellow GitHub chefs-in-training.
- Once merged, your recipe will be **automatically included** into our community cookbook!
