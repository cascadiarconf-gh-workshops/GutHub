## Instructions

1. Add your instructions here in a numbered list for people to follow.

2. If you'd like to include an image, upload your image to the `recipes/images/` folder. See #3 before uploading.

3. Make sure you rename your image with the same name as your recipe file before uploading.

4. Change the recipe.md's image filename in the frontmatter (between `---`). It looks like this: `image: "./images/your-image-filename.jpg"`
